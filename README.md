# LLM-written budget tracker
A substitution for my good ol' spreadsheet where I was entering all my balances twice a month - at higher and lower points.
This project is created to validate the ability of LLMs to write code on their own - 100% of the code is written by Cursor/claude 3.5 sonnet.
This text, however, is my own contribution.
